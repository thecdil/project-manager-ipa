Kat and Devin had a meeting to go through the project manager set up and delineate goals and milestones. 

This occured after an initial meeting earlier in September with all CDIL staff and Kat for initial introductions. 

Kat and Devin decided on bi-weekly meetings going forward, and they delineated several milestones and outputs via the forms in this site. 

TO DO: 

### Kat 

- drop off at noon tomorrow — unit folders … maps to be digitized and field forms (possibly coded)
  - needs it returned by December
  - by December (probably way sooner)
- video of map process
- start working on important fields from database. 
- send examples of websites that you’re liking 

### Devin/CDIL

- send instructions for titling/organizing images
- mess around with database in CB
- check digitized materials and see about data extraction / student work
- get meetings set up recurring
- project management site set up.
